# ISO2DFD sample
ISO2DFD: IntelÂ® oneAPI DPC++ Language Basics Using 
2D-Finite-Difference-Wave Propagation

ISO2DFD is a finite difference stencil kernel for solving the 
2D acoustic isotropic wave equation. Kernels in this sample 
are implemented as 2nd order in space, 2nd order in time scheme 
without boundary conditions. 
Using Data Parallel C++, the sample will explicitly run on the 
GPU as well as CPU to calculate a result.
If successful, the output will include GPU device name.
